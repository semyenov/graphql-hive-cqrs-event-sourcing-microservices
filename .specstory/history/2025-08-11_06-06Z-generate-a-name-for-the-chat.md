I can see there's a syntax error in your `shell.nix` file. The error message indicates there's an issue with a here-document (heredoc) that's not properly closed, causing a syntax error at line 688.

Let me examine the `shell.nix` file to identify and fix the issue:


---

Read file: shell.nix

I found the issue! The problem is in the Starship configuration section around line 645. There's a here-document (heredoc) that's not properly closed. The `STARSHIP_EOF` delimiter is missing its closing quote, and the heredoc structure is malformed.

Let me fix this:

        fi
  
```

</details>

Perfect! I've fixed the syntax error in your `shell.nix` file. The issue was that the here-document (heredoc) was using `EOF` as the closing delimiter instead of `STARSHIP_EOF`, which is what was specified in the opening `<< 'STARSHIP_EOF'` line.

The fix changes:
- `EOF` → `STARSHIP_EOF`

This ensures the heredoc is properly closed and matches the opening delimiter. Your shell environment should now load without syntax errors.
