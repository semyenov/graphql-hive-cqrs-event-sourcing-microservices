# Resolve TypeScript type conversion error (2025-08-07 19:03Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Conversion of type '{ id: `${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}`; type: TEventType; aggregateId: TAggregateId; version: number; timestamp: Timestamp; data: Extract<TEvent, { ...; }>["data"]; metadata: Record<...> | undefined; }' to type 'Extract<TEvent, { type: TEventType; }>' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
